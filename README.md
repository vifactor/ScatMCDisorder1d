Calculation of x-ray diffraction from 1d disordered system
by means of Monte-Carlo method. 
Scattering factor of an atom is calculated using the following the data from:
- D. Waasmaier & A. Kirfel Acta Cryst. (1995). A51, 416-413.
- S. Brennan and P.L. Cowan (1992), Rev. Sci. Instrum. 63, 850.
- Henke, B.L.; Gullikson, E.M.; Davis, J.C. X-ray interactions: 
       photoabsorption, scattering, transmission, and reflection at 
       E=50-30000 eV, Z=1-92, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables, 
       July 1993, vol.54, (no.2):181-342.
